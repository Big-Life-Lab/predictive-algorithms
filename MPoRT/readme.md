#MPoRT - Mortality Population Risk Tool

**Mortality Population Risk Tool (MPoRT).** A predictive algorithm for the calculation of 5-year risk of dying from all-causes. Developed and validated using the 2001 to 2008 Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) with approximately 1 million person-years of follow-up and 9,900 deaths. Focus on health behaviours (smoking, diet, physical inactivity and alcohol consumption). The model is currently calibrated for Canada, 2013, with provisions to calibrate to other countries.
