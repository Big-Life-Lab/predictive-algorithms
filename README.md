# Predictive algorithms reference documents

## Two documents describe the algorithms

**1) Questionnaire file**. This file describes questions for the predictors. The questions are the same as those questions in the surveys  or assessment instruments used to create the predictive algorithms. Also included are the allowed responses and response skip patterns.

The question file is a LimeSurvey survey template (.lss and .csv).  [https://www.limesurvey.org](https://www.limesurvey.org/)

**2) Algorithm file**. This file describes the method to calculate the risk of the outcome, based on the predictors from the questionnaire file.

The algorithm files are Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML 4.1) documents (.xml). [http://dmg.org](http://dmg.org/)

## Additional reference files

Indivudal algorithms may have additional reference files. These files are described in the README within each algorithm folder.

Examples of additional files include:

**1) Calibration data** - These data ensure algorithms provide well-calibrated estimates in different settings.[see reference 1 and 2] For the most part, calibration adjusts age and sex-speicific risk estimates based on the population distirubtion of predictors in different settings (i.e. countries) and rate of the risk outcome in a populaiton. Calibration files are tables stored as CSV or JSON files.

Please feel free to add calibration tables for different settings, or contact the algorithm development teams if you have an interested in calibrating algorithms for your setting.

**2) Algorithm development files** - The files contain code that was used to develop the algorithm or reference documents. For example, algorithms may contain the R databox code used to derivive predictive risks from the original development data. This R code can facilitate development, validation or calibration studies.

## How to calculate risk using the reference documents
There several approaches calculate risk using the provided documents:

1. The predictive algorithm parameters within the PMML files can be transcribed into all common programming languages or even used within spreadsheet programs such as MS Excel or Google Sheets.

2. PMML can also be used to within specifically-designed calculation or scoring engines such as [http://openscoring.io](http://openscoring.io/) or  [http://zementis.com/](http://zementis.com/).

3. We have an API to perform calculations, based on the PMML files within this repository. For example, see Heart and Stroke Foundationâ€™s eHealth Risk Assessment. [https://ehealth.heartandstroke.ca](https://ehealth.heartandstroke.ca) Please contact dmanuel@ohri.ca for more information about connecting to our API.

4. Individual risk calculations can be performed at [https://projectbiglife.ca](https://projectbiglife.ca)

## Suggestions and collaboration
We welcome suggestions to improve algorithm document or implementation of the risk tools. Feel free to open a new issue, pull request or fork.

We also welcome collaborations for future development, validation, calibration or application of the risk tools. Contact Doug Manuel [dmanuel@ohri.ca](mailto:dmanuel@ohri.ca)

## Algorithms

**Mortality Population Risk Tool (MPoRT).** MPoRT predicts 5-year risk of dying (all-causes) based on health beahviours (smoking, physical activity, alcohol, diet), sociodemogrpahic infomation (age, sex, immigrant status, education, etc.) and intermediate risks (Body Mass Index, hypertension, chronic diseases). The model is currently  calibratied for Canada, 2013, with provisions to calibrate to other countries.

**Cardiovascular Population Risk Tool (CVDPoRT).** CVDPoRT is currently under development. The protocol has been published. see [https://ehealth.heartandstroke.ca]http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/10/e006701.full. [https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02267447]. Trial registration number ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02267447.
