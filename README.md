# Predictive algorithms reference documents

## Two documents describe the algorithms

**1) Questionnaire file**. This file describes questions for the predictors. The questions are the same as those questions in the surveys  or assessment instruments used to create the predictive algorithms. Also included are the allowed responses and response skip patterns. 

The question file is a LimeSurvey survey template (.lss).  [https://www.limesurvey.org](https://www.limesurvey.org/)

**2) Algorithm file**. This file describes the method to calculate the risk of the outcome, based on the predictors from the questionnaire file. 

The algorithm files is a Predictive Modelling Markup Language (PMML 4.1) document. [http://dmg.org](http://dmg.org/)

## How to calculate risk using the reference documents
There several approaches calculate risk using the provided documents.
1. The predictive algorithm parameters within the PMML files can be transcribed into all common programming languages or even used within spreadsheet programs such as MS Excel or Google Sheets. 
2. PMML can also be used to within specifically-designed calculation or scoring engines such as [http://openscoring.io](http://openscoring.io/) or  [https://zemetis.com](https://zemetis.com). 
3. We have an API to perform calculations, based on the PMML files within this repository. For example, see Heart and Stroke Foundation’s eHealth Risk Assessment. [https://ehealth.heartandstroke.ca](https://ehealth.heartandstroke.ca) Please contact dmanuel@ohri.ca for more information about connecting to our API. 
4. Individual risk calculations can be performed at [https://projectbiglife.ca](https://projectbiglife.ca) 



## Suggestions and collaboration
We welcome suggestions to improve algorithm document or implementation of the risk tools. Feel free to open a new issue, pull request or fork. 

We also welcome collaborations for future development, validation, calibration or application of the risk tools. Contact Doug Manuel [dmanuel@ohri.ca](mailto:dmanuel@ohri.ca)
